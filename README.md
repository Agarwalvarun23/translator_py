# translator_py

## Description
A simple Python project that replaces all vowels in an English text with the letter 'g'. This project is built using nested `for` loops and basic `if-else` statements, making it ideal for Python beginners to practice logic building and string manipulation.

## Features
- Replaces both uppercase and lowercase vowels (`a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U`) with the letter 'g'
- Works for words, sentences, and paragraphs
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand logic
- No external libraries required

## How it Works
1. The program takes input from the user.
2. It iterates through each character in the string using nested `for` loops.
3. If a character is a vowel, it is replaced with 'g'.
4. The translated string is displayed as output.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Nested `for` loops
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file called `translator.py`.
3. Run the program using the terminal or command prompt:
```
python translator.py
```
4. Enter the text when prompted.
